OVERVIEW:
This is a repo containing the BOM and an STL file for a 4-pin pogo programmer (or 
general test point interface). Unfortunately, the native CAD file has been lost,
so all I can post is the STL.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Download, slice, and 3D-print the STL file. It should be on the order of an inch long,
so if the file you download is arond a millimeter long or on the order of 25 inches long,
you probably have an inches <> mm scaling issue.

2) Remove any support material from the pogo programmer print.

3) Use a soldering iron or other heat source to heat-stake the pogo pins into the holes
in the pogo programmer.

4) This bit is a bit tricky, but now fill the solder cups on the back of the pogo pins
and attach wires between the pogo pins and DE9 connector (or any connector you choose).
The trick is to not melt the pogo programmer when soldering wires to the pogo pins, so
be careful with the heat! Actually, reversing steps 3) and 4) might work better.
